                    <p class="text-muted">We talked to a few artists in order to validate the problem from their point of view. One of the interviews we conducted was with a local photographer who described to us how the process of finding customers usually works for him, highlighting the  <b> ups and downs </b> of this process and what can be improved in the future. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">Although for him the existence of this kind of platform is not a copulsory requirment, because the number of events he has is already enough, the idea of using our platform in the future is still of interest to him, given the fact that the way he currently finds his customers - which is through referrals - might become unuseful.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">Another important point he made was the fact that, for him, the most useful feature of such platform is the fact that the artists should be able to create their own presentation portofolios, in order to highlight their work.</p>
