                    <h4 class="service-heading">Initial problem</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">The problem was observed in our very own team when Vlad, for his 18th birthday, wanted to book a DJ and a photographer.
                        The photographer was easy to find, as he found him through a friend, but it was hard for him to find a DJ using platforms like Facebook and OLX.
                        He eventually found a DJ, but the experience was more stressful than it was supposed to.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        One of the main problems was that the availability of the artists was not posted on the platforms, so the only way to find it out was by calling them
                        and losing loads of time. From the artists' perspective, advertising their talent on a platform like Facebook can be quite tricky, as there is a chance
                        that they will not have enough reach to make themselves heard.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Our web application's purpose is to be the middleman between event organisers and live performers.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">From the artists' perspective, the application will allow the users to promote themsleves by sharing audio recordings or
                        video content of their previous performances.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">On the other hand, by using our application, the event organisers can use the integrated calendar to select a date and a time slot and browse
                        through all the available artists. When a certain artist has been selected, the organisers can check out the previous reviews and, if interested,
                        they can get in touch using the contact info provided within the application.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Because both the performers and the event organisers will use this application, we decided to create a Google Form that splits the problem in two
                        different parts. Firstly, we needed to validate the problem of the event organisers, as it is hard for them to find emerging talents.
                        Secondly, we needed to confirm that there is a problem with reach among performers.</p>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">Interviews - local photographer insights</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">We talked to a few artists in order to validate the problem from their point of view. One of the interviews we conducted was with a local photographer who described to us how the process of finding customers usually works for him, highlighting the  <b> ups and downs </b> of this process and what can be improved in the future. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">Although for him the existence of this kind of platform is not a copulsory requirment, because the number of events he has is already enough, the idea of using our platform in the future is still of interest to him, given the fact that the way he currently finds his customers - which is through referrals - might become unuseful.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">Another important point he made was the fact that, for him, the most useful feature of such platform is the fact that the artists should be able to create their own presentation portofolios, in order to highlight their work.</p>
                    <img src="img/interviews/interview_Maria.png" class="img-centered" alt="">
                    <p class="text-muted">All things taken into consideration, we discovered that some potential customers might be the local artists whose main difficulty is to create a network of clients for themselves and they need a means of becoming more known among their community. Furthermore, our idea seemed to be quite irrelevant for the well-established artists, whose schedule is already full. From the artists point of view, the main aim of our application is to help them gain some exposure.</p>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">Interviews - local business insights</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">We also needed to get validation with an event organizer, and so we got in contact with "La Librarie, Mon Cher", a local business in Pite»ôti, also called "the teahouse" by the locals. Initially we presented ourselves by contacting them on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LibrarieMonCher">Facebook page</a> and afterwards getting a face to face interview at the teahouse. This is where Mara helped me with answers to our questions, thus providing the necessary insights for validating the project.</p>
                    <img src="img/interviews/interview_vlad_teahouse.jpeg" class="img-floating-vlad" alt="">
                    <p class="text-muted">Throughout their activity they organized numerous events at the teahouse, like concerts with different bands, some of them being made of ambitious high school students. Besides music they also organized different events focused around children like workshops, carol evening events and others with numerous talented artists like illustrators and handicraftsman. Some of them are able to create art using simple objects like socks and a pack of rice, making this way snowmen and numerous other toys.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">Because they usually get in contact with artists using recommendations from other people, they find a centralized application that offers a way to find the right person for an event to be very useful. They provided us with feedback regarding the application's features that they find very useful in order for this to be considered as a viable alternative. The most important one is the ability to view the artist's profile, this feature being vital as it gives the organizer all the necessary information regarding the artist's performance and experience. Besides, having an advanced filtering system for each artist category, a rather <b>helpful and not disappointing review system</b> for the entry level artists that should not punish a beginner artist in case of a bad performance, a calendar view for the artist's schedule and a fair payment system that give artists the possibility to put different prices based on the task's complexity are some of the most important features the platform should provide.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">This interview provided us with new insights and findings, like the fact that there is a large variety of artists. Local businesses need artists for their events and the common means of collaboration between organizers and artists are not scalable and do not provide guidance in choosing the right artist for an event.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">We also needed to further understand the artists' views so we got in contact with Alex Dabulu, a DJ, music producer and sound engineer. We presented ourselves by contacting him on his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alexdabulu/">Instagram page</a> and getting the interview using the Instagram messaging application.</p>
                    <img src="img/interviews/interview_vlad_dabulu.jpeg" class="img-floating-vlad" alt="">
                    <p class="text-muted">Throughout his activity he released numerous songs on his <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/10KzG9AFe7cWEnwPttKTLF?si=DdmKS7x3RN-k1BzMNFHDgg">Spotify page</a> and managed to also get live performances. He mostly uses Instagram and Spotify as his main ways of promoting himself, this being overall a great success.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">Despite this, these methods of promoting come with downsides as well. For example, Instagram's algorithms are not completely fair with artists, because although an artist may have many <b>real</b> people following him, their posts visibility will be very low which in the end results in weaker engagement and overall a low exposure. Moreover, regarding live performances, some organizers may want a particular type of music in the case of music producers, and if you don't fit in that category it'd be less likely for you to get contacted by the organizers. Furthermore, it's very difficult to find events that need artists like you and therefore lots of research needs to be done, which is both time consuming and counterproductive.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">He gave us lots of useful feedback and new insights that's going to help us further develop our platform. Some of the most important features are the ability to show your work through your profile, the ability to get in contact with the organizer, a review system that does not promote hatered so that artists are not defamed, the possibility to view events happening next to you so that an artist can promote himself and the ability to provide a price range for the artist's services.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">This interview provided us with new insights and findings, like the fact that artists need the ability to find about existing events so that they can get in contact with organizers and that artists use numerous platforms for getting a better exposure, like Instagram, Spotify and others, so it is very useful to give them the possibility to promote whole portfolio.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">We created a form for event organizers that we shared on multiple platforms, including Whatsapp and Facebook groups.
                        Unfortunately, our survey was not accepted on some of the groups, probably because it was considered spam.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">However, we managed to receive 20 answers from event organizers, most of them being individuals.
                        Also, there were more people that organized events than artists that completed the survey, which is expected, as the same artists take part in different events.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">The event organizers mostly contacted DJs and photographers, but other kind of artists were contacted as well.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">We can see that most artists are contacted through phone calls or messages on social media platforms. Also, most of the contacted artists are well known locally.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">It seems that the event organizers either use social media platforms to meet and contact new artists or they don't use any app at all.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Also, the need for artists is not very frequent, while the most important factor taken into account when contacting them is the personal budget.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">The most frequent shortcoming encountered when contacting artists seem to be the time of response or the lack of response from them, but other shortcomings were presented too.
                        Also, if the event organizers are pleased with an artist's performance, they usually collaborate with them again in the future.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">From the answers received, it looks like the ArtistryHub app would be well received, no matter if it would be a mobile or web app. Also, all of its main features would be appreciated.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Given all of the received answers from the event organizers, we identified a pattern that allowed us to see how useful the ArtistryHub app would be.
                        Most of the organizers contact local artists from time to time, but they are not happy with their variety, availability and response time.
                        They would like to use a web app where they can filter, review and contact artists, while seeing their availability for a specific time.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">We strongly believe that we are ready to move to the customer validation stage, as we got enough answers to make a clear picture of the usual users.</p>

                        we realised that there is an interest for this kind of application, but we still need to refine some of the initial aspects of our app.
                        For instance, one of the new features, which was suggested in the Google Form, would be to allow the artists to browse through events that
                        were posted by organisers, which is basically the opposite of our initial approach. This way, the artists and the organisers can
                        contact eachother for future collaborations.</p>
