                    <p class="text-muted">The problem was observed in our very own team when Vlad, for his 18th birthday, wanted to book a DJ and a photographer.
                        The photographer was easy to find, as he found him through a friend, but it was hard for him to find a DJ using platforms like Facebook and OLX.
                        He eventually found a DJ, but the experience was more stressful than it was supposed to.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        One of the main problems was that the availability of the artists was not posted on the platforms, so the only way to find it out was by calling them
                        and losing loads of time. From the artists' perspective, advertising their talent on a platform like Facebook can be quite tricky, as there is a chance
                        that they will not have enough reach to make themselves heard.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Our web application's purpose is to be the middleman between event organisers and live performers.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">From the artists' perspective, the application will allow the users to promote themsleves by sharing audio recordings or
                        video content of their previous performances.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">On the other hand, by using our application, the event organisers can use the integrated calendar to select a date and a time slot and browse
                        through all the available artists. When a certain artist has been selected, the organisers can check out the previous reviews and, if interested,
                        they can get in touch using the contact info provided within the application.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Because both the performers and the event organisers will use this application, we decided to create a Google Form that splits the problem in two
                        different parts. Firstly, we needed to validate the problem of the event organisers, as it is hard for them to find emerging talents.
                        Secondly, we needed to confirm that there is a problem with reach among performers.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">We talked to a few artists in order to validate the problem from their point of view. One of the interviews we conducted was with a local photographer who described to us how the process of finding customers usually works for him, highlighting the  <b> ups and downs </b> of this process and what can be improved in the future. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">Although for him the existence of this kind of platform is not a copulsory requirment, because the number of events he has is already enough, the idea of using our platform in the future is still of interest to him, given the fact that the way he currently finds his customers - which is through referrals - might become unuseful.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">Another important point he made was the fact that, for him, the most useful feature of such platform is the fact that the artists should be able to create their own presentation portofolios, in order to highlight their work.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">All things taken into consideration, we discovered that some potential customers might be the local artists whose main difficulty is to create a network of clients for themselves and they need a means of becoming more known among their community. Furthermore, our idea seemed to be quite irrelevant for the well-established artists, whose schedule is already full. From the artists point of view, the main aim of our application is to help them gain some exposure.</p>

                        Unfortunately, our survey was not accepted on some of the groups, probably because it was considered spam.</p>

                        They would like to use a web app where they can filter, review and contact artists, while seeing their availability for a specific time.</p>

                        They would like to use an app where they can create a profile, search for opportunities and create their own network. Our goal should not be to stop them from leaving the platform, but to expand our network, so that it can be a real hub that can help any artist. </p>

                        we realised that there is an interest for this kind of application, but we still need to refine some of the initial aspects of our app.
                        For instance, one of the new features, which was suggested in the Google Form, would be to allow the artists to browse through events that
                        were posted by organisers, which is basically the opposite of our initial approach. This way, the artists and the organisers can
                        contact eachother for future collaborations.</p>
